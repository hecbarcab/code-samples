## Summary
This repository contains code snippets from projects (both professional and personal) in which I have been directly involved, and which can be publicly distributed. All code contained in this repository is subject to MIT license.

## Professional projects
* [CUDA-accelerated Eulerian Fluid Solver](https://github.com/hecbarcab/code-samples/tree/main/cuda-eulerian-fluid). Implementation of a grid-based Eulerian simulator solving the incompressible Euler equations. The solver employs a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme and a Jacobi-based pressure solver for the divergence-free projection. It supports dynamic Dirichlet boundary conditions for simple geometric shapes, which is used for modelling user interaction. Used as basis for two of the works of my Ph.D. thesis.
